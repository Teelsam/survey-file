Certification Project from FreeCodeCamp

# Introduction

*Hello* This marks me independant attempts to grow my **web dev** knowledge. Having passed a university coding bootcamp I'm now traveling solo in the web dev world.

# FreeCodeCamp

*FreeCodeCamp* Allows users to learn and practice fundamentals of web dev. I have been keeping my skills sharp by daily coding practice, through this site.

# Files

Attached are the two files I created going through the first cerfication project.

**Index.html** holds my html code and is the spine of the survey-files functions. Please go thorugh and read my commentation!

**Styles.css** holds the design portion of the survey-file.I chose bright high contrast colors to have my survey stand out from the typical blues and whites.I am happy to recieve any advice or comments and am also capable of creating sites to match any style or preference. 

### Thank you for your time!
